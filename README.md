# INTROSPECTOR - Gamified Webgl Quiz
 
 We have developed an interactive game that allows the players to learn about the James Webb Telescope in a way that is not only accessible to the players but also closes the gap between high-level concepts and the inaccessibility to understand them. This project gives players an option to get a simulation of what the James Webb Space Telescope “sees” as the players may explore in a 3D view. Not only that, but it also allows the players to understand the amazing capabilities of the James Webb Telescope and makes them aware of its huge impact on space research.
 
## INSTRUCTIONS TO USE OUR PROJECT

Our project is built on unity version 2021, which is a 3D/2D game engine and powerful cross-platform IDE for developers. And it is rendered using WebGL which is a JavaScript for rendering high-performance 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser.

Our project contains 13 scenes each, and for adding functionality like:-

->Rotating telescope or scenes </br>
->Adding sound to the scene </br>
->Adding skybox </br>
We have used C# scripting in which we used inbuilt functions like (rendersettings.skybox, input.getacess ,transform.rotate) for adding specific functionality to our project.
